1. **Largest Element in an Array**
   - **Bruteforce Approach**: Using Sort method
     - Time complexity: O(N log N)
     - Space complexity: O(1)
   - **Optimized Approach**: By initializing the first value of the array as high and comparing each element in the array with high
     - Time complexity: O(N)
     - Space complexity: O(1)
